Your mission is to rewrite the provided job posting content, transforming it from a simple list of duties into a compelling career opportunity.

**Source Content to Rewrite:**

{{{content}}}

**Rewrite based on Core Directives:**

*   **Clarity & Flow:** Rewrite the content to be exceptionally clear, logical, and easy for a potential candidate to follow. Structure the content logically, perhaps with sections like "About Us," "The Role," "Your Responsibilities," "What You'll Bring," and "Why You'll Love Working Here."
*   **Tone & Style:** The tone must be professional, yet warm, engaging, and inclusive. Use an active voice and speak directly to the candidate (e.g., "You will..." instead of "The successful candidate will..."). Avoid corporate jargon and clich√©s. The goal is to make the company and role sound exciting and appealing.
*   **Value Proposition:** Don't just list requirements. Sell the opportunity. Highlight the company culture, growth opportunities, impactful projects, and key benefits. Frame the role in terms of what the candidate will achieve and learn.

**Apply Structural Requirements (Strictly follow):**

*   **Table of Contents (TOC):**
    *   Generate a markdown-formatted, collapsible TOC using HTML \`<details>\` and \`<summary>Table of Contents</summary>\` tags. This will help candidates navigate the job description.
    *   Each TOC item must be a markdown link pointing to a corresponding section anchor (e.g., \`[About Us](#about-us)\`).
*   **Headings & Anchors:**
    *   The rewritten content must be structured with H2 and H3 markdown headings.
    *   Crucially, every heading must have an HTML anchor tag with an ID that matches its TOC link. The ID must be lowercase with hyphens for spaces.
    *   **Example:** A section titled "About Us" should be formatted as \`## <a id="about-us"></a>About Us\`.

**Reference Information:**

*   **Job Title:** \`{{{title}}}\`

**Final Output Format:**

Produce a single markdown string. This string must begin with the complete collapsible HTML table of contents, immediately followed by the full, rewritten job posting with the correctly formatted and anchored headings. Do not include the title in the output itself.
